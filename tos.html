   <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">3. Changes to the Terms or Services</h2>
   <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    We may modify the Terms from time to time, for example, to reflect changes to our Services (e.g., adding new features or benefits to our Services or retiring certain features of certain Services) or for legal, regulatory, or security reasons. If we do this, we’ll provide notice of the changes, such as by posting the amended Terms and updating the “Last Updated” date or, if the changes, in our sole discretion, are material, we may notify you through our Services or other communications.

   <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">When you create a SwiftEarn.com account, we consider that to be an inquiry about our products and services, which means that we may also contact you to share more details about what we have to offer (i.e., marketing).
